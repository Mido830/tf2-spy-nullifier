# tf2-spy-nullifier
This mod changes decloaking sound to a whistling sound and dead ringer's fake death decloaking sound to a f*cking vuvuzela.

**Q:** How to download it?<br/>
**A:** Click on the green button "Code" -> "Download ZIP".


**Q:** How to install it?<br/>
**A:** Put "Spy-Nullifier" folder inside Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom and run the game.


**Q:** How to uninstall it?<br/>
**A:** Simply delete "Spy-Nullifier" folder.


**Q:** Does it work in Valve servers?<br/>
**A:** Yes.


**Q:** Does it work in community servers?<br/>
**A:** Yes.


**Q:** Does it work in Faceit servers?<br/>
**A:** Yes.


**Q:** Does it work on servers with sv_pure 2 parameter (maximum restriction)?<br/>
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** Can it be detected by watching demos/P-REC demos?<br/>
**A:** No. What sound is heard on demos depends only on the watcher's tf2 configuration. So a person without this mod won't hear any difference.

**Q:** How does it work?<br/>
**A:** Inside "tf2_misc_dir.vpk" file there is a file called "game_sounds_player.txt". That file tells the game what sound should be played for certain actions. The game doesn't verify at all whether you have modified that file or not. This has been known for years. BTW that's exactly how Mastercomfig's No Soundscapes mod works.


**Q:** How can I make it less obvious? I'm a streamer.<br/>
**A:** The game lets you control pitch and volume of sounds via scripts but you cannot increase volume of default spy sounds because it seems the default values are already as high as they can be and everything higher is ignored. However you could make a mod that decreases volume of all sounds except the spy sounds and crank up your system volume. I'm too lazy to do such mod, though.


**Q:** Why did you create this? It's basically a cheat!<br/>
**A:** Yes, it is. It's a perfect, undetectable cheat. It has been discovered at least 6-7 years ago but not many people know about it and Valve doesn't seem to care. I created this mod to prove it's possible to make such a mod and to increase the chance for Valve to patch it.
